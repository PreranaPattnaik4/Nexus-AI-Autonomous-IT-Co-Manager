# **App Name**: Nexus AI

## Core Features:

- Real-time Dashboard: Display real-time data on IT tasks, system metrics, and alerts via data fetched from Firestore. Users can get a quick overview of their systems and the agent's current actions.
- Goal-Based Task Management: Submit IT management goals in natural language (e.g., 'Ensure all production servers are patched'). The system translates the goal into actionable steps.
- Multi-step Task Execution: The agentic loop that uses Gemini to break down goals into actionable steps. Then executor processes each step. Users can use this tool for Slack and Jira integrations.
- Proactive Issue Resolution: Trigger goal-planning processes to resolve issues autonomously. Users don't need to describe what is happening to kick start a task.
- RCA Report Generator: The AI analyzes task logs (stored in Firestore) to generate human-readable reports. The user can see and understand why something occurred and how the issue was resolved
- Jira Integration: Integrate the tool with Jira to create/update tickets.
- Slack Integration: Integrate the tool with Slack to post notifications about task statuses and completed actions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3B82F6) to reflect intelligence, security, and clarity; to inspire trust from the user. 
- Background color: Light blue (#F0F9FF), almost desaturated blue and near white for a clean workspace.
- Accent color: Violet (#8B5CF6) that sits to the 'left' of blue on the color wheel to highlight calls to action and important data points in the UI.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif that presents a neutral and modern appearance.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use consistent, professional icons to represent IT functions and statuses.
- Clean, organized layout with clear sections for the dashboard, task view, metrics, and goal input. Prioritize easy navigation and quick access to key information.
