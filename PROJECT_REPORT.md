# Nexus AI ‚Äì Autonomous IT Co-Manager
## SuperHack 2025 Project Report

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview

*   **Project Title**: Nexus AI ‚Äì Autonomous IT Co-Manager
*   **Purpose**: To transform traditional IT operations into an intelligent, self-healing system that automates Root Cause Analysis (RCA), proactive alert resolution, and system insights.
*   **Vision**: An agentic AI platform capable of managing tasks, diagnosing failures, and optimizing performance autonomously, acting as a true co-manager for IT professionals.
*   **Hackathon Context**: SuperHack 2025 (Google Cloud + Firebase AI Challenge).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

Traditional IT monitoring is reactive, manual, and heavily human-dependent. Teams are often stuck in a cycle of firefighting‚Äîresponding to alerts after downtime has already occurred. This leads to operational inefficiency, extended incident resolution times, and an inability to focus on strategic initiatives.

Nexus AI addresses these challenges by providing:
*   **Real-Time Awareness**: A centralized dashboard offers an immediate overview of system health, active tasks, and critical alerts, powered by real-time data synchronization with Firestore.
*   **Proactive Self-Healing**: Instead of just flagging issues, Nexus AI autonomously initiates resolution workflows. The "Resolve with AI" and "Retry with AI" features use Gemini to create and execute new plans to fix problems as they happen.
*   **Intelligent RCA Generation**: When incidents occur, Gemini analyzes execution logs to automatically generate human-readable RCA reports, saving engineers hours of manual investigation.
*   **Human-AI Collaboration**: Through a natural language chat interface and goal-based task input, IT managers can collaborate with Nexus AI as if it were a highly skilled team member.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Technical Architecture

Nexus AI is built on a modern, serverless, and AI-native stack, designed for real-time responsiveness and intelligent automation.

*   **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router with Server Components), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, and ShadCN for UI components.
*   **Backend**: Firebase (for authentication and real-time data), with Next.js Server Actions handling backend logic, eliminating the need for separate cloud functions for most operations.
*   **AI Layer**: Google's Gemini Pro API, orchestrated through Genkit flows. This manages goal decomposition, RCA generation, and conversational intelligence.

**Core Agentic Flow**:
`Goal Input` ‚Üí `Planner Agent (Gemini)` ‚Üí `Subtasks (Firestore)` ‚Üí `Executor Agent (Simulation)` ‚Üí `Log Analysis` ‚Üí `Reporter Agent (RCA)` ‚Üí `Insights Generation`

**Firestore Collections**:
*   `/tasks/{taskId}`: Stores goals, progress, and nested steps.
*   `/reports/{reportId}`: Contains AI-generated RCA reports.
*   `/alerts/{alertId}`: Holds active and resolved system alerts.
*   `/systems/{systemId}`: Stores mock data for system health metrics.
*   `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}`: Manages conversational history (future enhancement).

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ üß† Autonomous Development by Gemini (Self-Built Logic & UI Enhancements)

This section highlights what I, Gemini, developed autonomously as your AI co-developer during the build process. These decisions and implementations were made to optimize the system and enhance the user experience beyond the initial prompts.

*   **Independent Code Architecture & Troubleshooting**:
    *   **Dependency Hell Resolution**: I autonomously diagnosed and resolved a series of critical `npm install` failures. By analyzing `ETARGET` and `ERESOLVE` errors, I identified conflicting peer dependencies between `next`, `genkit`, and various `@genkit-ai` packages. I systematically tested version combinations, corrected invalid package names (`@genkit-ai/googleai` vs. `@genkit-ai/google-genai`), and aligned all dependencies to a stable, compatible set, finally allowing the project to build.
    *   **Build & Server Error Correction**: I identified and fixed Next.js server startup errors, such as the `unknown option '--turbopack'` by modifying the `package.json` run scripts. I also fixed `Module not found` errors by restoring the correct dependencies and imports for the `ai` package after it was misconfigured during dependency troubleshooting.
    *   **Logic Migration**: I made the decision to consolidate all backend and AI flow-triggering logic into **Next.js Server Actions** (`src/lib/actions.ts`). This created a cleaner, more secure architecture by eliminating the need for separate API route handlers and simplifying state management between the client and server.

*   **UI/UX Enhancements & Proactive Suggestions**:
    *   **Autonomous Page Creation**: I designed and built the **Integrations**, **Settings**, **Command Console**, and **Chat** pages from scratch, including placeholder layouts with pre-styled ShadCN components that matched the existing dark theme.
    *   **Proactive "Retry with AI" Feature**: After implementing the initial task failure state, I suggested adding a "Retry with AI" feature to enhance the system's self-healing capabilities. I then autonomously implemented the UI button and the corresponding `retryTask` server action, which uses Gemini to analyze the failure and generate a new, corrected plan.
    *   **Layout and UX Refinements**: I autonomously reordered the main navigation in `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` to place "Chat" in a more prominent position above "Dashboard" based on user feedback. I also improved the dashboard layout to group related cards together for better visual flow.

*   **Backend Reasoning and Data Simulation**:
    *   **RCA Workflow Design**: I designed the `generateRcaReportFlow`, which fetches task logs from Firestore, passes them to Gemini for analysis, and saves the resulting Markdown report back to the `/reports` collection.
    *   **Realistic Data Visuals**: I enhanced the dashboard charts (CPU, Memory, Network I/O) by implementing logic to generate realistic, time-series data with random variance, transforming them from static displays into dynamic, live-updating visualizations.
    *   **Expanded Chat Intelligence**: I proactively expanded the conversational agent's capabilities. It now uses multiple tools to query not just RCA reports, but also live system health, task status, and active alerts from Firestore, transforming it into a true System Health Assistant.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Demo Flow Summary

1.  A user submits a high-level goal like *"Ensure all production servers are patched"*.
2.  Gemini, via the `multiStepTaskExecution` flow, breaks it down into an actionable plan, creating a new task in Firestore.
3.  The UI updates in real-time, showing the task "in-progress" as the Executor Agent simulates each step.
4.  An alert, such as *"High CPU on Cache Server"*, appears on the dashboard. The user clicks **"Resolve with AI."**
5.  Gemini autonomously creates and starts a new task to diagnose and fix the CPU issue.
6.  Another task fails. The user clicks **"Retry with AI."** Gemini analyzes the failure log, creates a corrected plan, and supersedes the failed task.
7.  The user asks the **System Health Assistant**, "How many tasks are failing?" and gets a real-time answer.
8.  Once a task is complete, the user can view a detailed, AI-generated RCA report. The dashboard updates with the latest task stats and a new weekly **AI Insight**.
